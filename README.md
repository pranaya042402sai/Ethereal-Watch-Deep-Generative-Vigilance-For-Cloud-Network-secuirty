We developed an Robust Intrusion Detection System which can detect the malicious traffic on the cloud .
To Achieve this we used three machine learning algorithms that are Decision Tree, Random Forest And Support Vector Machine.
We used Two Deep Generative models That are Conditional Denoising Adversial Autoencoder and K nearest Neighbor
along Those we also provided an Authentication for Secure Login 
The Database we used is Sqlite3 and datasets are Kdd-cup , UNSW-NB15
at final we Achieved an 98 percent accuracy
